### Directory and File Descriptions

#### `cmd/`
Contains the main applications for this project. The `api/` subdirectory is where the main.go file for starting the API server resides.

- `api/main.go`: Entry point of the application. Initializes and starts the API server.

#### `internal/`
Houses packages that are specific to this project and not intended for external use.

- `api/`: Contains API-specific code.
  - `handlers/`: Request handlers for each API endpoint.
  - `middleware/`: Custom middleware functions.
  - `routes.go`: Defines API routes and links them to handlers.
- `config/`: Configuration management for the application.
- `models/`: Data models and DTOs (Data Transfer Objects).
- `repository/`: Data access layer, interfacing with the database.
- `service/`: Business logic layer, implementing core functionality.

#### `pkg/`
Shared packages that could potentially be used by external projects. Place reusable, non-project-specific code here.

#### `scripts/`
Utility scripts for development, CI/CD, database migrations, etc.

#### `tests/`
Contains test files separated into integration and unit tests.

- `integration/`: API-level and end-to-end tests.
- `unit/`: Unit tests for individual functions and methods.

#### `deployments/`
Configuration files and scripts for deploying the application.

- `docker/`: Dockerfile and related configurations for containerization.
- `kubernetes/`: Kubernetes manifests for orchestration.

#### `docs/`
Project documentation, API specifications, and any other relevant documentation.

#### Root Files
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `go.mod` and `go.sum`: Go module files for dependency management.
- `Makefile`: Defines commands for building, testing, and deploying the application.
- `LICENSE`: Contains the MIT License text.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project structure.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project root.
3. Run `go mod tidy` to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
4. Use the provided Makefile commands for common tasks:
   - `make build`: Build the application
   - `make test`: Run all tests
   - `make run`: Run the application locally

## Development Workflow

1. Implement new features or bug fixes in the appropriate packages under `internal/`.
2. Write unit tests in the same package as the code being tested.
3. Write integration tests in the `tests/integration/` directory.
4. Update API documentation in the `docs/` directory as necessary.
5. Use the `scripts/` directory for any automation tasks.
6. Update deployment configurations in `deployments/` if there are infrastructure changes.

## Deployment

Refer to the `deployments/` directory for Docker and Kubernetes configurations. Ensure to update these as the application evolves.
